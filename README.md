Getting started with GitHub

## GitHub

The following definition of GitHub comes from [Kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, 
as well as track and control changes to their code. 
To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles: 
Version control, which helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code, 
and Git, which is a specific open-source version control system.
